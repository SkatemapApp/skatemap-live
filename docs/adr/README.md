# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Skatemap Live.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

- **Title**: Short descriptive name (e.g., "Railway PaaS for Deployment Platform")
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision?
- **Decision**: What is the change that we're proposing?
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult as a result of this change?
- **Alternatives Considered**: What other options were evaluated and why were they rejected?
